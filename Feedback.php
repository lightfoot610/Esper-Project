•	A key feature of industry teams is the ability to give and receive feedback
•	 particular to members of a team in which you are working. In order to give you some experience at this, your group
should login to the SparkPLUS tool (instructions on how to do this 
•	will be given on Canvas). Each person should provide an assessment of each member of the group, including themselves. 
This will then provide feedback to each of you, and in particular, on how the rest of the team view’s your performance.
•	You do not need to include any information about the feedback you receive, as this is intended to give you experience
with use of tools such as these, and how the information is gathered and processed in such tools. The markers will, however, 
check that each person in the group has contributed via SparkPLUS, and the marks for this section will only be awarded if
all group members have contributed in an appropriate manner by the assignment deadline.
•	If you have any concerns with this process, please raise these with your tutor or lecturer. In particular, if you wish
to have a group discussion about this feedback, please contact the lecturer who will facilitate a group discussion on this topic.
