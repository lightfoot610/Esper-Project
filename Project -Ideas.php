You are to come up with a project idea for the group as a whole, which could be an individual’s idea, but is more likely to be
a combination of each of the ideas you had individually, together with comments and feedback from your Assignment 1 marker, 
instructor, and anyone else who you would like to consult.
•	You may also wish to consider what problems need to be solved, for which there are many sources of information,
such as the ones below. There are many more websites like these, of course.

•	There is no set length for this section, but it is difficult to see how a description of less than 500 words would be adequate.
Do not limit yourself to this if you have more than this to write, though - but it should be in a well written and concise format. 
If you are unsure of how much to write, ask your instructor for advice.
